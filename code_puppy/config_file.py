"""Bounded, recoverable I/O for Code Puppy's INI configuration file.

The public helpers in this module keep config-file safety concerns out of the
already-large :mod:`code_puppy.config` module. Built on the generic
primitives in :mod:`code_puppy.atomic_io`:

* reads are size-bounded before parsing, preventing pathological lines from
  exhausting memory;
* only confirmed content corruption is quarantined -- ordinary I/O failures
  still propagate;
* recovery and writes share a cross-process lock;
* quarantine names are collision-resistant and never overwrite a backup; and
* writes use a same-directory temporary file followed by atomic replacement.
