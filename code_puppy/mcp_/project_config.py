"""Project-level MCP server configuration discovery + trust gating.

Code Puppy loads MCP server definitions from the user-level
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/code_puppy/mcp_servers.json``. This module adds an
*optional*, **trust-gated** project-level source at
``<CWD>/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`` so a team can version-control the MCP
servers their repo needs — mirroring the existing project-level discovery for
agents, skills, and plugins.

Why a trust gate?  A ``stdio`` MCP server runs an arbitrary command, and a
project can also ship an agent (``.code_puppy/agents/*.json``) that declares an
``auto_start`` binding to one of these servers. That combination is a
code-execution vector the moment you open a freshly cloned repo. So, exactly
like project *plugins* (see :mod:`code_puppy.plugins.trust`), project MCP
configs are **disabled until the user explicitly trusts them** via
``/mcp trust``.

Trust model (identical philosophy to ``code_puppy/plugins/trust.py``):

* Trust store lives **user-side** at ``~/.code_puppy/trusted_mcp.json`` — a repo
  can never self-trust.
* Trust is **content-addressed**: a SHA-256 of the project config file, scoped
  to the resolved project path. Any edit to the file reverts it to "changed"
  and demands re-acceptance (blocks silent-update attacks, same as direnv's
  ``allow``).
* **Fail closed**: an unreadable store, malformed JSON, or an unhashable file
  all resolve to "not trusted" → the project config is silently ignored.
* **A file can't be its own less-trusted twin**: the project candidate can
  resolve to the very same file as ``config.MCP_SERVERS_FILE`` — the usual
  way being ``<CWD> == $HOME`` under the default config location. That file
  is already loaded as user-level (implicitly trusted), so there is nothing
  to gate and :func:`get_project_mcp_servers_file` returns ``None``.

    Like :func:`code_puppy.config.get_project_agents_directory`, this never
    creates anything — the team opts in by committing the file.

    Returns ``None`` when the candidate resolves to the *same file* as
    :data:`code_puppy.config.MCP_SERVERS_FILE`. That is the case whenever
    ``<CWD>/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`` and the user-level config are one
    path — most commonly ``CWD == $HOME`` under the default config location,
    which is the normal state for anyone who just runs ``code-puppy`` from
    their home directory. (With ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` set the user-level file
    lives elsewhere and the two are ordinarily distinct — which is why the
    check is against ``MCP_SERVERS_FILE`` itself, never against ``$HOME``.)

    loaded as user-level (implicitly trusted). Reporting it as an untrusted
    *project* config would be simply false — it told the user "its servers
    are NOT loaded" while they were in fact loaded — and ``/mcp trust`` would
    be ceremony over a decision the user already made by writing the file.
