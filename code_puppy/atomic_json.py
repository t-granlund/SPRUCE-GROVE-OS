"""Bounded, recoverable I/O for Code Puppy's hand-edited JSON config files.

The JSON counterpart to :mod:`code_puppy.config_file` -- built on the same
:mod:`code_puppy.atomic_io` primitives -- for state files users are expected
to hand-edit (``mcp_servers.json``, ``extra_models.json``, ``spinners.json``,
...). These carry the identical three failure modes the PUP-605 config-file
fix addressed for the INI config: unbounded reads, torn writes, and no
cross-process lock, and are arguably more exposed since they're hand-edited.

Unlike INI config (which is exclusively owned by Code Puppy and safe to
quarantine-and-reset on corruption), a hand-edited JSON file failing to
parse is far more likely to be a *typo the user just made* than bitrot --
silently resetting it to ``{}`` would be a worse outcome than the crash this
module exists to prevent. So corruption here is surfaced to the caller as
:class:`JsonFileCorrupt` rather than auto-quarantined; each call site keeps
its own warn-and-fall-back-to-default behavior on top of that.
