"""macOS consolidated keyring backend for Code Puppy.

Stores every secret in a single macOS Keychain item (one JSON blob) so
the user sees at most one Keychain access prompt regardless of how many
secrets Code Puppy stores.

Why this exists
---------------
A macOS Keychain item carries an ACL naming which binaries may read it
without prompting. The ACL is anchored to the calling binary's identity.
The interpreter that talks to Keychain is uv's managed CPython, which is
ad-hoc signed (no stable Team ID), so its identity is its cdhash. Every
Python version bump produces a new cdhash, misses the stored ACL, and
prompts the user once per keychain item. With a dozen secrets that is a
dozen "Always Allow" dialogs after a routine upgrade. One item means one
ACL and therefore one prompt.

Scope
-----
This backend is registered only on macOS, only when the active backend is
the stock macOS one, and only when the user has not pinned their own
backend. Off macOS the native ``keyring`` backend is used unchanged. The
``secret_store`` public API does not change; consolidation is a backend
concern that callers never observe.
