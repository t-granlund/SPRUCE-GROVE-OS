"""Generic OS keyring secret store for Code Puppy.

Reads and writes secrets through the operating system keyring, with a
permission-hardened JSON file fallback as a final safety net.

Write strategy (three tiers, in order):
  1. **Direct keyring write** -- used when the value fits in one entry.
  2. **Chunked keyring write** -- the value is split into ≤``_CHUNK_SIZE``
     pieces when the OS imposes a per-entry size cap.  The primary real-world
     case is Windows Credential Manager, which rejects blobs larger than
     ~2 560 bytes UTF-16-LE (error 1783); long tokens routinely exceed
     this.  Chunking keeps the keyring as the source of truth.
  3. **Permission-hardened file fallback** -- used only when both keyring
     strategies fail (genuinely broken backend, backend crash, headless CI).
     Written atomically and restricted to the owner: ``0o600`` on POSIX, and
     an owner-only NTFS DACL (via ``icacls``) on Windows.  If the Windows ACL
     cannot be applied, the fallback warning says so plainly -- the file is
     then plaintext with default inheritance, not owner-only protected.

Read strategy:
  The keyring is queried first (with transparent chunk reassembly).  The
  fallback file is always consulted as a last resort so secrets written there
  by a previous session (after exhausting both keyring options) are still
  recoverable even when the keyring subsequently becomes healthy.

The keyring service name is configurable via ``configure_service_name`` so
each distribution can namespace its secrets and never read, copy, or alias
secrets across builds.  The default is ``"code-puppy"``; downstream
distributions override it at startup.
