"""Search/filter helpers for the ``/resume`` (autosave_load) session picker.

Lives separately from :mod:`code_puppy.command_line.autosave_menu` so that
file (already overweight at ~700+ lines) does not grow further. Everything
in here is pure / IO-tolerant so it is unit-testable without spinning up
a prompt_toolkit ``Application``.

The picker UX mirrors ``/set``: pressing ``/`` enters search mode, alphabet
chars append to a buffer, ``Enter`` commits the buffer, ``Esc`` cancels the
search. The novel bit is that this picker filters on *session content* --
the concatenated text of every message in each session -- rather than just
the timestamp/metadata visible in the left menu. Content is loaded lazily
and cached for the picker's lifetime so we do not re-unpickle session
files on every keystroke.
