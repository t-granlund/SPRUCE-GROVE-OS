"""Shared terminal ownership for full-screen TUI menus.

``menu_session()`` is the one context manager every interactive picker
wraps itself in (per the ``set_awaiting_user_input`` docstring rule that
components taking over the terminal are responsible for suspending the
run UI). It layers Code Puppy's app concerns on top of termflow's
``terminal_session`` (which owns raw mode + a single alternate screen
across chained menus):

1. ``suspended_run_ui()`` — releases the bottom bar's scroll region and
   the global key listener's grip on stdin.
2. ``PauseController.pause()`` — the message renderer buffers all
   ``emit_*`` output for the duration; the buffer flushes onto the
   primary screen at resume, instead of painting over (and flickering
   under) the menu in the alternate screen.

Menus inside a session must run with ``alt_screen=False``; the session
owns the screen. Reentrant: both layers are refcounted, so nested
pickers (pin-a-model inside the agent picker) share the outer session.
