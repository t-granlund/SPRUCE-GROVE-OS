"""Retry *policy* layer: named backoff profiles for streaming retries.

This module is the **policy** counterpart to the retry **mechanism** in
``_runtime.streaming_retry``. The mechanism knows how to loop, sleep, classify,
and log; this module decides *how many* attempts and *how long* to wait between
them -- as a small set of named, guard-railed profiles the user can select per
role (main agent vs sub-agent) and override per model.

Design guarantees (why you can't shoot your foot off)
-----------------------------------------------------
* Every delay is clamped to ``[MIN_DELAY_SECONDS, MAX_DELAY_SECONDS]`` -- the
  30s ceiling is a hard cap the user cannot exceed, and the 1s floor plus the
  exponential ramp make a pathological "10 retries in 10 seconds" impossible.
* Attempt counts are clamped to ``[1, MAX_ATTEMPTS_CEILING]``. A hand-edited
  config with ``retry_main_max_attempts = 999`` still resolves to the ceiling
  (100), whose worst-case backoff (~49.5 min) is bounded far below a runaway.
* Clamping happens at *read* time (:func:`resolve`), so a bad config value can
  never produce a pathological retry -- the guardrail isn't just in the UI.

The three strategies are all exponential-with-equal-jitter; they differ only in
how aggressively the exponent ramps toward the 30s cap:

* ``gentle``     -- eases up slowly; more early retries, later ones grow gradually.
* ``balanced``   -- classic doubling-ish ramp (the default).
* ``aggressive`` -- jumps to the 30s cap fast; best for hard rate limits where
  short waits are pointless and you want to sit at the max wait ASAP.

"Equal jitter" means each delay is ``half + random(0, half)`` of the capped
exponential value, so retries never synchronise into a thundering herd against a
shared gateway, yet never collapse below ``half`` of their intended spacing.
