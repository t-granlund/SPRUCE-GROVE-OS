"""Keyboard listener thread helpers, extracted from ``BaseAgent``.

These functions listen for Ctrl+X (shell cancel) and the configured
cancel-agent key (when it's not bound to a signal like SIGINT).

The listener exposes a ``KeyListenerHandle`` so consumers can
``suspend`` it (release stdin) while another UI component takes over the
terminal, then ``resume`` it — otherwise two readers fight over stdin
and the terminal ends up bricked.
