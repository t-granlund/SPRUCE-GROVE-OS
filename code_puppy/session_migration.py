"""One-shot sweep of legacy ``contexts/`` into the unified ``autosaves/`` store.

History: in earlier versions, named sessions lived in
``~/.code_puppy/contexts/`` (populated only by the obscure ``/dump_context``
slash command) and auto-saved sessions lived in ``~/.code_puppy/autosaves/``
(populated automatically by the interactive autosave loop). Under the
unified store, ``-r NAME``, ``/dump_context NAME``, and ``/load_context NAME``
all read and write ``autosaves/``. This module moves any files a power user
had ``/dump_context``'d into the legacy location so they remain visible.

The sweep is deliberately small: no flock, no quarantine, no slugification.
``contexts/`` was nearly empty for almost all users pre-Phase-1 (the
``/dump_context`` command is manual and obscure), so the typical sweep
moves zero files. When it does move files, name conflicts are genuinely
rare because autosave names follow ``auto_session_<ts>`` and user-named
entries are anything else. A skip-with-warning policy handles the rare
collision without needing a collision subsystem.

The sweep is **idempotent** via a sentinel file. Two simultaneous startups
racing the sweep are benign -- ``os.replace`` is atomic per file, the loser
of any per-file race sees the destination already exists and skips, and the
sentinel is touched atomically.
