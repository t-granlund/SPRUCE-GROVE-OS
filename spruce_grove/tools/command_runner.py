    """SIGINT during shell execution: stop the swarm responsively.

    Ctrl+C is a pure keybinding — with a raw-mode key listener owning
    stdin, ^C arrives as ``\\x03`` and cancels via the key-listener path
    (``make_schedule_cancel``) instead of here. This handler is the
    out-of-band fallback: ``kill -INT``, piped stdin (no TTY listener),
    or ^C landing in a cooked-mode gap between raw readers.

    ORDER MATTERS, and it's the opposite of what you'd naively expect:

    1. **Hide the panel** (``_tear_down_live_panels``) -- instant, non-blocking.
    2. **Emit the banner** -- instant; the user gets immediate feedback.
    3. **Kill the shells** (``kill_all_running_shell_processes``) -- SLOW and
       BLOCKING. ``_kill_process_group`` sleeps up to ~2.1s *per process*
       (SIGTERM->SIGINT->SIGKILL escalation), so a deep swarm with N nested
       sub-agents each holding a ``sleep`` shell can block the main thread for
       N x ~2s. If we killed first (the old order), the spinner's Rich Live
       kept repainting the sub-agent panel for that entire window and the
       teardown/banner only landed *after* every shell died -- which is
       precisely the "panel stays up until all the shells finally stop" bug.
    4. **Cancel the swarm** (``_AGENT_CANCEL_CB(force=True)``). Shells are
       already dead by here, so the anti-orphan reason for force-cancel holds.

    A one-shot ``_SIGINT_CANCEL_REQUESTED`` flag dedupes the banner + sweep
    so mashing Ctrl+C during teardown doesn't spam either.
